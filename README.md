# msrittables
a repo to keep all of the msrit time tables for each branch
the purpose of this repo is actually to hold all the timetables of MSRIT so that they can be converted and displayed in the upcoming timetable feature 

## how to contribute
 - just add your branch / year/ section timetable and name appropriately 
 - open a pull request once you do so

any contributions are welcome since we want to have as many time tables as possible. thank you :)
